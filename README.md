# Vocabulary.trainer

Vocabulary builder app for learning foreign languages.
This project is my first attempt at TDD in React with Redux. I am also hoping to get into some more advanced features in Google Firebase during this project.

Possible features:
* Smart repetition based on individiual previous results.
* Save and load lists of words.
* Import and export lists of words from other formats/apps.
* Share lists of words with other users.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
